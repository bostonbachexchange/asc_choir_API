    { title: '#1 May Nothing Evil Cross This Door', composer: 'Robert N. Quaile', lyricist: 'Louis Untermeyer', type: 'Hymn #1',
    lyrics: '|`|May nothing evil cross this door,|and may ill fortune never pry about|these windows; may the roar|and rain go by.| `|By faith made strong, the rafters will|withstand the battering of the storm.|This hearth, though all the world grow chill,|will keep you warm.|`|Peace shall walk softly |through these rooms,|touching our lips with holy wine,|till every casual corner blooms|into a shrine.|`|With laughter drown the raucous shout,|and, though these sheltering walls are thin,|may they be strong to keep hate out|and hold love in.',
