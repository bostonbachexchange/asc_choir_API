# HARMONY HAVEN

## Pitch
CHORDIALLY YOURS is a choir app that will take your choir to the next level. 

## Premise
This platform allows choir members to connect to other members in their chorus. Users find choral works to practice and add to their repertoire list. Create an opportunity to connect and share ideas and build community.

## Installation and Technologies
1. This app uses dependencies with `npm install`, express, node.js, mongodb, mongoose and react.

## STRETCH GOALSâ€¦
* As a user, I want to be able to search ALL music through a search bar
* As a user, I want to add multiple comments to each post on the message board (subdocument)
* Only an admin can create and delete music/repertoire
